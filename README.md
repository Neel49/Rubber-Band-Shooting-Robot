# Rubber-Band-Shooting-Robot
Learn how to make a completely automatic 144-shot rubber-band machine gun robot

The most important part of the robot is the barrel. It's what makes it so unique. The barrel is composed of 4 metal pieces screwed together around one large shaft.

The metal pieces are as shown below. There are two things about them that make them so special. The first is the triangular shape. This allows rubber bands to placed upon them in a precarious position. The next is the fact that they are all bent in one direction. This will be important to take note of for the future.

First a long string is placed around the barrel as such all the way till the end, remember to tie it to a piece of the metal at the front.

Next we place rubber bands on the slots on the barrel on each of the metal pieces as such.

Now let's explain the mechanism. The way we've structutured is now we have rubber bands placed all across the barrel, with a piece of string underneath it, and when we pull the piece of string, the rubber bands should start shooting. The hard part is now done. Now the rest of the robot just provides a base to drive around on, and and additional motor to pull the string. The way the robot automatically pulls the string, is with a smaller rubber band "barrel" placed below the main barrel as shown. That smaller barrel is what is connected to the motor. And all that's left to do is tie the string onto the smaller barrel. Now as the motor moves the smaller barrel, it will start pulling the string, rotating the main barrel and shooting rubber bands. Now it's important to mention again why the barrel splots are bent, this so that they are parrallel to the direction of the string when it is about to pull the rubber-band (in short it makes the motion smoother. )

Congrats, that's it, all it takes to build a rubber-band shooting robot.
